        <h1 class="Header">Academics</h1>
        <p class= "Rectangle-paragraph-text"> I am in the top 2% of my high school. I am pursuing the IB diploma, and I also take  AP tests along with the IB tests. My favorite classes include Calculus BC and Theory of Knowledge.

        <p class="Rectangle-paragraph-text"> My college and career objective is to pursue a B.S. in Computer Science. I’ve taken a college course in Python programming, 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming, and a college course in calculus, 21-122: Integration and Approximation, at Carnegie-Mellon University as part of their Advanced Placement/Early Action Summer Pre-College Program. 

        <p class="Rectangle-paragraph-text">Along with Python programming, I’ve taken an introduction to AutoCAD class in high school. I am also independently studying HTML for web designing.</p>

    <div class = "rectangle" id="rectangle-2">
        <h1 class="Header">Athletics</h1>
        <p class= "Rectangle-paragraph-text"> I have been swimming for over 12 years including all 4 years of high school, along with swimming club competitions for all 12 years. I’ve qualified for state competitions for both club and high school, and I have also qualified for Zones and Quad competitions which are regional club competitions. I, along with 3 teammates, hold our high school record in the 200 freestyle relay. My main strokes include backstroke, IM, and freestyle.

        <p class = "Rectangle-paragraph-text">Along with swimming I enjoy competing in high school Track and Field in the spring. I have run for 3 years and plan to continue this upcoming spring; I have lettered all 3 years and I plan to continue the trend this upcoming season. My main events are the 400 meter dash, and the 4x400 relay.</p>

    <div class = "rectangle" id ="rectangle-3">
        <h1 class = "Header">Volunteering</h1>
        <p class= "Rectangle-paragraph-text">“Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.” This is the Special Olympics motto I live and breathe. Outside of school and swimming, I take time every week to volunteer as a coach and Unified Partner for the Porter County Special Olympics Swim Team. I devote 2 hours every Sunday, and when I can, an hour on Wednesdays, to help improve stroke techniques and overall fitness. 

        <p class = "Rectangle-paragraph-text"> Not only a coach, but I also enjoy chaperoning Special Olympic swimmers to full-day meets, and even the full- weekend Special Olympics Summer Games.

        <p class = "Rectangle-paragraph-text"> Apart from volunteering with Special Olympics I enjoy taking part in local food drives and pantries, helping to donate and deliver food to the needy.

        <p class = "Rectangle-paragraph-text"> I also give back to my school community by peer tutoring students to help for standardized tests or  just helping understand certain topics in math, english, or science.</p>
